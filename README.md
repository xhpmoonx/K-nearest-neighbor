# K-nearest neighbor
The script utilizes K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification to predict the class of a rice sample. It starts by loading and normalizing data from an Excel file. The user provides input for a new rice sample's features. This input is appended to the dataset, and the updated data is then used to calculate Euclidean distances between the new sample and existing samples. The script identifies the K-nearest neighbors based on these distances, determines the majority class among them, and assigns this class to the new sample. The script also visualizes the effects of normalization on various features.
